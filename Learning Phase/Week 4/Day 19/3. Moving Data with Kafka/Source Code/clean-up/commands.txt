# Stop all running containers
docker stop $(docker ps -q)

# Remove all stopped containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

To ensure all containers related to Kafka and other services are removed, you can run:
docker rm -f zookeeper kafka mysql connect mysqlterm

Remove Docker Images
Next, if you want to remove all Docker images (including Kafka, Zookeeper, MySQL, and Debezium), run:

docker rmi $(docker images -q)

To remove specific images (e.g., Kafka or MySQL):
docker rmi debezium/kafka:1.0 mysql:5.7 debezium/connect:1.0


Remove Docker Networks
If you created a custom Docker network (kafka-net), you can remove it as well:
docker network rm kafka-net

docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)

If you want to clear out all the Docker images and containers in your system to fully clean it up, run:
