Setting up  Kubernetes with MicroK8s on your Ubuntu system 
============================================================

Install MicroK8s on Linux

sudo snap install microk8s --classic


Add your user to the microk8s admin group
MicroK8s creates a group to enable seamless usage of commands which require admin privilege. Use the following commands to join the group:

sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER
sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube

You will also need to re-enter the session for the group update to take place:

su - $USER


Check the status while Kubernetes starts

microk8s status --wait-ready

Turn on the services you want

microk8s enable dashboard dns ingress

Try microk8s enable --help for a list of available services and optional features. microk8s disable ‹name› turns off a service.

Start using Kubernetes

microk8s kubectl version 

microk8s kubectl get nodes

microk8s kubectl get all --all-namespaces

Access the Kubernetes dashboard

microk8s dashboard-proxy

Start and stop Kubernetes to save battery


Kubernetes is a collection of system services that talk to each other all the time. 
If you don’t need them running in the background then you will save battery by stopping them. 
microk8s start and microk8s stop
will do the work for you.
